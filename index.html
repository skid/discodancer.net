      <p>Hi. I&#39;m Dushko. I&#39;m a software engineer living in Skopje, Macedonia. This is my professional bio/resume site.</p>
<h2 id="paketmk-current">Paket.mk (current)</h2>
<p>I&#39;m currently working at <a href="https://paket.mk">Paket.mk</a> as 1/2 of the engineering team. I started there in September 2021 with the goal to transform an online grocery store built with Woocommerce into a national marketplace platform. As of this moment, Paket.mk has onboarded several merchants and we&#39;re seeing a 50% year-on-year growth, which, belive it or not, makes us the most successful online retailer in North Macedonia by any measure.</p>
<p>However, given the size of the Macedonian market, it&#39;s gonna take a while until Paket.mk becomes a company that can benefit from and support a significant engineering team. Right now we&#39;re at a point where the business development needs to catch up with the tech we created so this gives me time to work on other things.</p>
<h2 id="h4-2015-2021">H4 (2015-2021)</h2>
<p>In late 2015, together with a close friend of mine, and his former boss (both ex-JPM bankers) I co-founded <a href="https://hfour.com">H4</a>. The following 6 years I was the CTO of H4 and built an engineering team of around 60 people. We raised a total of $27 million, grew the company to about 125 people, failed to reach a product-market fit and finally wound it down at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The 30 second elevator pitch for the H4 product I can give is: &quot;Google Docs for huge investment banks&quot;, but in reality it&#39;s much more complicated than that, as is everything when you work with the world&#39;s largest banks.</p>
<p>Our product consisted of a web-based rich text editor, document management system and interfaces for capturing document metadata. Our infrastructure handled <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/materialinsiderinformation.asp">MNPI</a> data which complicated thigs a lot across the board - be it on the technical, organizational or even political side of things.</p>
<p>During my 6 years at H4, I had the privilige to hire and work with the best people I&#39;ve met in my carreer. I think it&#39;s not a stretch to say that between 2017 and 2020 H4 had the best engineering team of that size (25-50) ever assembled in Macedonia.</p>
<h2 id="before-that">Before that</h2>
<p>I started programming in 2007 while at university, studying Economics. For the first 8 years I was building software mostly alone or as part of small teams. I&#39;ve worked with all kinds of programming languages, but mostly on web projects. Nowadays I enjoy working with Typescript.</p>
<h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in touch?</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve landed here, maybe you have some specific questions. I&#39;m glad to answer them! I&#39;m based in Skopje, North Macedonia. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:jordanovskid@gmail.com">jordanovskid@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in working me - I&#39;m experienced in making software (for the web mostly), growing engineering teams, doing product/business analysis and the whole &quot;building a company&quot; thing.</p>
