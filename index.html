      <p>I&#39;m a software engineer, co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://hfour.com">H4</a> .</p>
<p>This is my home page, which is a collection of links to stuff that I&#39;ve built, written or like.</p>
<h2 id="i-build-software">I build software</h2>
<p>I started in 2007 while at university, studying Economics. For the first 8 years I was building software mostly alone or as part of small teams. I&#39;ve worked with all kinds of programming languages, but mostly on web projects. Nowadays I enjoy working with Typescript.</p>
<p>In late 2015, I co-founded H4, which is now a 120 people company with offices in Macedonia, UK and the US. We build a cloud documentation platform for huge financial institutions like JP Morgan. I&#39;m currently the CTO of H4. I mostly work on growing the engineering organization and setting the strategic product direction.</p>
<p>By now I&#39;d say that I am experienced in building enterprise software, growing engineering teams and the whole &quot;building a company&quot; thing.</p>
<h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in touch?</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve landed here, maybe you have some specific questions. I&#39;m glad to answer them! I&#39;m based in Skopje, Macedonia but I travel regularly to London, UK, in case you want to meet in person.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me privately, or in relation to my github projects, please use <a href="mailto:jordanovskid@gmail.com">jordanovskid@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s related to H4, please use <a href="mailto:dj@hfour.com">dj@hfour.com</a></p>
