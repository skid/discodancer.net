      <h2 id="dushkos-self-isolation-blog-day-1">Dushko&#39;s self-isolation blog: Day 1</h2>
<p>This blog series is dedicated to my good friend Sara Sollors. I will write about my 2 week self-imposed isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>I just landed from London and my government has issued an order that I need to stay at home for 14 days because the UK is, according to our ministry of health, a &quot;medium risk&quot; country. Really, this just means that the UK is slightly more infested than Macedonia, but I think that there was a tiny bit of satisfaction to get back at them for having a super expensive visa regime towards us.</p>
<p>When I traveled to London 4 days ago the situation was ... waveable away. Optimistic as I am, I did not expect that Macedonia, of all places, would pose travel restrictions to the UK, but there you go.</p>
<p>As soon as we landed back in Skopje, UK got hit by our governmental banhammer and passengers arriving from there will be sent back. This clip is a good depiction of how I felt:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRpIXhOCmM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRpIXhOCmM</a></p>
<p>Then I learned that our government is not <em>that</em> crazy after all and the ban is only valid for foreign passengers, but still - had we arrived a day later we might have been put in a non-self-imposed isolation which I don&#39;t think has WiFi.</p>
<p>Anyway - feels good to be back, would have been terrible to be stuck in the UK or in a Macedonian quarantine. Not the least because, if not corona, then my wife would have definitely killed me so she can dance the &quot;I told you so&quot; dance on my grave. She did tell me not to go.</p>
<p>Also - No symptoms. I am healthy. Stay tuned.</p>
