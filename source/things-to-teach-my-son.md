# Things to teach my son

Now that I have a son, I thought I should write down all the things that I deem super important that my son should know.

1. Evolution
2. Entropy
3. Scientific method
4. Find meaning in life, despite the heat death of the universe
5. The difference between "just an idea" and "a treatise" is the examples that you find which support and disprove your idea, together with rebuttals.
6. Be a better man than your father (do the legwork to turn ideas into treateases).
7. University is important for three things: Learning about prior art so you don't reinvent the wheel, learning the jargon so you can understand prior art and discuss with others in the field and expanding your network of people.
