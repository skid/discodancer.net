# Things to teach my son

Now that I have a son, I thought I should write down all the things that I deem super important that my son should know.

1. The idea behind the theoury of evolution.
2. The idea behind Entropy.
3. The idea behind the scientific method.
4. How to find meaning in life, despite the heat death of the universe.
5. The difference between "just an idea" and "a treatise" is the examples that you find which support and disprove your idea, together with rebuttals. Finding them is the bulk of the work you put in that makes a difference between "smart" and "smart and succesful".
6. University is important for three things: Learning about prior art so you don't reinvent the wheel, learning the jargon so you can understand prior art and discuss with others in the field and expanding your network of people.
7. Why freedom of speech is important.
