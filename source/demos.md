Some stuff I've made over the last X years. A lot of it is outdated most likely, but whatever.

## Gravity flowers

A simplistic and (probably wrong) physics engine that spins a bunch of dots in 2D space simulating gravity. You can control the mass, initial speed and initial distance between the dots and see where they end up.

The cool idea was to draw lines connecting pairs of dots as they move which ended up rendering interesting images. You can also save the image by righ-clicking the generated snapshot on the right.

Check it out [here](/extras/gravity-flowers.html)

## IGoogle clone (eyegee)

Back in 2013 or so, Google decided to discontinue IGoogle, which was my homepage at the time so I had to build my own. I only recreated the functionality I used from it and it doubled as an [Angular learning exercise](https://github.com/skid/angular-widgetbox). This means that the code is quite obsolete.

It runs on this server, and you're free to use it [here](http://eyegee.discobot.net)

## The H4 Platform

This is a presentation I gave in late 2018 at H4. It's purpose was to explain abstraction and system design to my Banker/Lawyer buddies and set the tone for the future of the H4 platform.

Have a look at it [here](/extras/h4-platform)
