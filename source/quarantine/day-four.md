## Dushko's self-isolation blog: Day 4

This day was the day before yesterday. As all days look alike now, I completely forgot what I was doing the day before yesterday. But I can do a good guess:

1. I worked from home
2. More people got sick
3. The government told even more people to stay home
4. Some teenagers were partying in the suburbs.
5. My son spilled more juice/milk on surfaces hard to clean.

Stay tuned, a couple of more posts are coming immediately.
