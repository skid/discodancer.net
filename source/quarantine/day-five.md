## Dushko's self-isolation blog: Day 5

Ok, this was yesterday. I remember what happened:

I worked from home.

More people got sick (around 32 in total I think)

Government proclaimed a state of emergency. Also upcoming elections are postponed.

At a ministry of health press conference journalists asked the minister a very curcial question: Since "that time of the year is coming", should people start home renovations now? The minister said - "There will be time for renovations".

The irony in all this is that later in the evening me and my wife were reviewing the final design renders for the apartment we're renovating.

On a more geopolitical note, I'm now (or, rather, became yesterday) quite certain that this will be a mega recession that's gonna stay for a while.
