## Dushko's self-isolation blog: Days 7-10

Hah, this is cheating, right? Four days in one post, I know. But the days are so similar that it doesn't really make any difference, unless you want me to talk about work.

Here's what happened in 4 days:

The online groceries order we made on day 7 arrived today. I tasted fresh bread after so long, since my wife does not let me bake this [Quarantine Bread](https://andyljones.com/posts/bread.html#fn-dutch), the latest excuse being "we're low on yeast and you can't buy it anymore"

Macedonia enacted a curfew from 21:00 until 6:00, then another curfew for people over 67 and under 18 - they want them separated. All kinds of fun stuff online with the curfew - people on balconies filming people caught on the streets hiding from the police and so on.

The world exploded with new infections. Macedonia seems to be handling it quite well, though. While most of europe has tens of thousands sick, there are around 150 here and the growth doesn't seem to accelerate. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much are we testing.

It started fucking snowing two days after it was 20 degrees outside. Marko had fun catching snowflakes on the balcony.

Overall, I feel pretty normal. But today I realized that once the self-isolation period ends ... nothing much will really change. I'll be able to go to the store and that's it. Social distancing means: no babysitters, no social activities, no boardgames, no hanging out with other people, which kind of defeats the purpose of going outside, save for workout - which I don't do.

This might be a good time to take up running...
