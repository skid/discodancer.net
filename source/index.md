I'm a software engineer, co-founder and CTO of [H4](https://hfour.com) .

This is my home page, which is a collection of links to stuff that I've built, written or like.

## I build software

I started in 2007 while at university, studying Economics. For the first 8 years I was building software mostly alone or as part of small teams. I've worked with all kinds of programming languages, but mostly on web projects. Nowadays I enjoy working with Typescript.

In late 2015, I co-founded H4, which is now a 120 people company with offices in Macedonia, UK and the US. We build a cloud documentation platform for huge financial institutions like JP Morgan. I'm currently the CTO of H4. I mostly work on growing the engineering organization and setting the strategic product direction.

By now I'd say that I am experienced in building enterprise software, growing engineering teams and the whole "building a company" thing.
