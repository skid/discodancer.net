Hi. I'm Dushko. I'm a software engineer living in Skopje, Macedonia. This is my professional bio/resume site.

## Paket.mk (current)

I'm currently working at [Paket.mk](https://paket.mk) as 1/2 of the engineering team. I started there in September 2021 with the goal to transform an online grocery store built with Woocommerce into a national marketplace platform. As of this moment, Paket.mk has onboarded several merchants and we're seeing a 50% year-on-year growth, which, belive it or not, makes us the most successful online retailer in North Macedonia by any measure.

However, given the size of the Macedonian market, it's gonna take a while until Paket.mk becomes a company that can benefit from and support a significant engineering team. Right now we're at a point where the business development needs to catch up with the tech we created so this gives me time to work on other things.

## H4 (2015-2021)

In late 2015, together with a close friend of mine, and his former boss (both ex-JPM bankers) I co-founded [H4](https://hfour.com). The following 6 years I was the CTO of H4 and built an engineering team of around 60 people. We raised a total of $27 million, grew the company to about 125 people, failed to reach a product-market fit and finally wound it down at the end of 2021.

The 30 second elevator pitch for the H4 product I can give is: "Google Docs for huge investment banks", but in reality it's much more complicated than that, as is everything when you work with the world's largest banks.

Our product consisted of a web-based rich text editor, document management system and interfaces for capturing document metadata. Our infrastructure handled [MNPI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/materialinsiderinformation.asp) data which complicated thigs a lot across the board - be it on the technical, organizational or even political side of things.

During my 6 years at H4, I had the privilige to hire and work with the best people I've met in my carreer. I think it's not a stretch to say that between 2017 and 2020 H4 had the best engineering team of that size (25-50) ever assembled in Macedonia.

## Before that

I started programming in 2007 while at university, studying Economics. For the first 8 years I was building software mostly alone or as part of small teams. I've worked with all kinds of programming languages, but mostly on web projects. Nowadays I enjoy working with Typescript.

## Get in touch?

If you've landed here, maybe you have some specific questions. I'm glad to answer them! I'm based in Skopje, North Macedonia. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:jordanovskid@gmail.com">jordanovskid@gmail.com</a>

If you're interested in working me - I'm experienced in making software (for the web mostly), growing engineering teams, doing product/business analysis and the whole "building a company" thing.
