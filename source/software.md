# Thoughts on software making

In the 6 years between 2015 and 2021 I went from someone who had never worked in a team bigger than 3 people to someone who was in charge of 60+ people and the delivery of multi-million dollar contracts. This experience has profoundly changed how I look at the art of making software. In some ways I've become someone that my youger self would loathe, but now I can see why that's necessary.

The first thing to remember is that software, for the most part, is built for people to _1) use it_ and _2) pay for it_. Clearly, some software is free and some software is not intended to be shipped, but if you write software for a salary, you probably write it for one, or more likely, both of these reasons. This is the most frequently forgotten rule by people at all levels in a hierarchy that I had to put it first. It's probably the most common cause of death for companies. And this is not particularly software related. It's actually business-related. It's basically this: If a company doesn't make money - it will end.

At the beginning of my startup founder journey I didn't know this. As a CTO, I understood my role in a purely technical sense. At the beginning I was programming the initial pilot and I hiring software developers - I did not pay enough attention to what the product was. It was fairly early that we had some red flags that we collectively chose to ignore. One of them was the size of the MVP vs the size of the total market. We had estimated that the total addressable market for our initial product was around $25M but we also knew that we would need a company of 100+ people to properly support and develop the our product. We also knew that changing people's habits would be extremely difficult and we're would be lucky if we had 10% of the market in the first few years.

Even though

## Why are you building it?

- What differentiates good from great is their work ethic
- Communication with people
- Culture is where your money comes from
- Software is a business
- Good sales compensates for a bad product
