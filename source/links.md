## Some interesting links, not in any order

1. [New Dark Age](https://kirstenhacker.wordpress.com/2019/08/24/new-dark-age/): "_He has described a situation in which a model cannot be falsified. Instead, the model lasts for as long as people believe in it. That is religion, not science._"
2. [The story of us](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html): An amazing and long blog post series that sets up its own language and thinking framework to explain modern society and how to reason about it.
3. [Japan: It's not funny anymore](https://kotaku.com/japan-its-not-funny-anymore-5484581): One of my favorite blog posts. Despite the title, I found every piece of critique in there so exciting and fun. This post is probably the sole reason why I decided to travel to Japan twice and conviced at least a few others do the same.
