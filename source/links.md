## Some interesting links, not in any order

1. [New Dark Age](https://kirstenhacker.wordpress.com/2019/08/24/new-dark-age/): "_He has described a situation in which a model cannot be falsified. Instead, the model lasts for as long as people believe in it. That is religion, not science._"
2. [The story of us](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html). An amazing and long blog post series that sets up its own language and thinking framework to explain modern society and how to reason about it.
