          <p>Some stuff I&#39;ve made over the last X years. A lot of it is outdated most likely, but whatever.</p>
<h2 id="gravity-flowers">Gravity flowers</h2>
<p>A simplistic and (probably wrong) physics engine that spins a bunch of dots in 2D space simulating gravity. You can control the mass, initial speed and initial distance between the dots and see where they end up.</p>
<p>The cool idea was to draw lines connecting pairs of dots as they move which ended up rendering interesting images. You can also save the image by righ-clicking the generated snapshot on the right.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="/extras/gravity-flowers.html">here</a></p>
<h2 id="igoogle-clone-eyegee">IGoogle clone (eyegee)</h2>
<p>Back in 2013 or so, Google decided to discontinue IGoogle, which was my homepage at the time so I had to build my own. I only recreated the functionality I used from it and it doubled as an <a href="https://github.com/skid/angular-widgetbox">Angular learning exercise</a>. This means that the code is quite obsolete.</p>
<p>It runs on this server, and you&#39;re free to use it <a href="http://eyegee.discobot.net">here</a></p>
<h2 id="the-h4-platform">The H4 Platform</h2>
<p>This is a presentation I gave in late 2018 at H4. It&#39;s purpose was to explain abstraction and system design to my Banker/Lawyer buddies and set the tone for the future of the H4 platform.</p>
<p>Have a look at it <a href="/extras/h4-platform">here</a></p>
